# Sorting Visualizer

This repo visualizes three sorting algorithms for now, namely Insertion Sort, Selection Sort and Bubble Sort.

## Insertion Sort
It is similar to sorting playing cards, we split the cards into sorted and unsorted group, and a card is picked from unsorted group and placed in sorted group. Initially, the first element is considered sorted and the other elements are compared with it.


## Selection Sort
In selection Sort, the smallest element is selected from the unsorted list and placed as the first element of the unsorted part untill all the elements are sorted.

## Bubble Sort
It is similar to bubbles present underwater, where the largest bubble reaches the surface of water at first. Here, the largest elements finds it's position at first. The adjacent elements are repeatedly swapped if they are not in right order.
